Notice: an alternative to the Arduino Nano may be needed for this project.
Most Arduino Nano modules available these days use a ceramic resonator to clock the processor, instead of a crystal.
This causes too much drift in the tracking accuracy, although it does not affect frequency stability in 'hold' mode.
My prototype Track-hold-VFO project used a Nano module with a 16MHz crystal instead of a ceramic resonator.
Sorry about the oversight - I forgot to include that detail in the article.
I have only recently discovered that these crystal-equipped Nanos may no longer be available.
I am currently searching for an alternative, and will update this readme with more details soon.

To download the Arduino source code for this project:  
Right-click 'Tracking-VFO-VK3JST.ino' in the file list and select 'Save Link As...' from the drop-down menu.  
An alternative method is to left-click the file to display it on your screen, then click the 'Download' icon.
